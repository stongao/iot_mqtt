Description: This file will run on the Intel Edison
This file configures the edison as a client to an MQTT broker at IP = brokerIP
This client is subscribed to topics (QoS):
- LightStatus (2)
- Status/Arduino (2)
- Status/RaspPi (2)

Depending on values recieved from the broker, it will toggle
GPIO pins.

To use this file you must install the paho.mqtt python library:
Found at -> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1

For configuring this program to work in your environment:
1) Ensure that you are connected to the same wifi network as the broker
2) Enter the IP address of your broker at 'brokerIP'
3) Enter the port number at 'brokerPort' that your broker will 
   accept connections at (default:1883)
4) Ensure GPIO pins are connected correctly

Signal	      |     SparkFun   |     MRAA
lightstatus   |       14       |      36
statusArduino |       49       |      47
statusRaspPi  |       47       |      46

Callbacks:
on_connect -> When client receives a CONNACK response from broker
on_message -> When the client receives a message from MQTT broker that it is subscribed to
